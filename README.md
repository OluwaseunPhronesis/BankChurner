### Introducton

The Project is to know the to the Proportion of the Existing customer and the Attrited customers for the the bank to know their progress. So, I use Gtbank as case study but the data used was not Gtbank Dataset.

### Objective 
- To determined why the customer are leaving and to win then back ðŸ˜§ 
* To understand the demand trends in the market and ensure that the active customers are happy and less likely to churn.

### Analysis

### Insight
* Having the Married Customers as the highest number of attrite customer where female have the larger number by gender, I presumed the Couples relocated to another State and there was Inadequate onboarding procedures in that area close to them.  
### Recommendation
* The more customers you have, the less losing one will hurt you. It goes without saying that in order to have a lot of customers, you need to minimize attrition as low as possible.
* And the best way to stop attrition is to track customer data on the regular basis and respond to feedback (i.e making sure that you provide thorough onboarding that builds customer engagement from the start.)
